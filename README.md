## 1. INTRODUCTION

This program suite provides comprehensive mine clearance operations planning for Mine Countermeasures (MCM) assets. The calculator determines the number of passes required to achieve a specified confidence level that mine density has been reduced to an acceptable threshold.

### 1.1 Purpose

The program enables operational planners to:

- Calculate required MCM passes for desired confidence levels
- Estimate expected mine encounters during operations
- Determine operational timeline including disposal operations
- Assess residual risk after clearance operations

### 1.2 System Requirements

SwissMicros DM32 calculator with RPN operating system. Program requires approximately 185 program steps.

## 2. DISCLAIMER

### IMPORTANT NOTICE

This calculator program and associated documentation contain only non-classified information based on publicly available theoretical concepts and mathematical calculations. All methodologies, equations, and operational parameters described herein are derived from unclassified academic and technical sources.

**Intended Use:** This program is provided for instructional and educational purposes only. It is designed to demonstrate mathematical modeling techniques applicable to mine clearance operations planning. Users are responsible for validating all calculations and applying appropriate operational security measures when using this tool in any professional capacity.

The developer (jacober-calc) makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of this program for any particular operational purpose. Actual mine clearance operations involve complex tactical, environmental, and technical factors beyond the scope of this theoretical model.

**Users must:**

- Consult appropriate operational authorities before applying these calculations to real-world scenarios
- Verify all results independently using approved operational planning tools
- Maintain operational security when discussing or applying these techniques
- Recognize that this is a simplified model and actual operations require comprehensive risk assessment

## 3. THEORY OF OPERATIONS

### 3.1 Probability Model

The program uses a Poisson distribution model to calculate the probability of mines remaining after clearance operations. The model assumes:

- Mines are distributed randomly throughout the area
- Each pass is an independent detection event
- Detection probability P remains constant across passes

### 3.2 Key Equations

#### Lambda (Expected Mines Remaining)

```
λ = D × (1 - P)^N × A
```

Where D is density, P is detection probability, N is number of passes, and A is area. Lambda represents the expected number of mines remaining in the entire area of operations after N passes.

#### Expected Mine Encounters

```
E = D × A × (1 - (1 - P)^N)
```

This calculates the total number of mines expected to be detected during N passes.

#### Confidence Calculation

The confidence C that actual mines remaining ≤ M is calculated using the cumulative Poisson distribution:

```
C = Σ(k=0 to M) [λ^k × e^(-λ) / k!]
```

#### Time Calculation

```
T = [(A × N) / (V × S) + E × H] / O × 24
```

Where V is velocity, S is swath width, H is handling time per mine, and O is operational tempo.

### 3.3 Area of Operations

Mine clearance operations involve systematic coverage of the designated area using an MCM asset that follows a search pattern (typically lawn-mower pattern) with defined swath width.

### 3.4 Program Logic Flow

The master program (LBL M) executes an iterative algorithm to determine the minimum number of passes required to achieve the commander's intended confidence level.

**Program Flow:**
1. Initialize N = 0
2. Increment N
3. Calculate Lambda (λ) using XEQ W
4. Calculate Confidence (C) using XEQ Y
5. Check if C ≥ I (intended confidence)
   - If NO: return to step 2
   - If YES: continue to step 6
6. Calculate E (encounters) using XEQ U
7. Calculate T (time) using XEQ V
8. Display results

## 7. EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS

### 7.1 Complete Mission Planning

**Scenario:**

A mine clearance operation requires 95% confidence that no more than 1 mine remains in a 12.5 nm² area with estimated density of 3.45 mines/nm². The MCM asset has 54% detection probability, 0.1 nm swath, operates at 10 knots, with 20 hours/day operational tempo and 2.5 hours handling time per mine.

**Solution:**

Press: `XEQ M`

| Prompt | Enter | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| I? | 0.95 | Intended confidence |
| M? | 1 | Max acceptable mines |
| D? | 3.45 | Mine density |
| A? | 12.5 | Area |
| P? | 0.54 | Detection probability |
| S? | 0.100 | Swath width |
| V? | 10 | Velocity |
| O? | 20 | Operational tempo |
| H? | 2.5 | Handling time per mine |

**Results (displayed on screen from top to bottom):**

| Register | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| T | 234.00000 | 234 total hours |
| Z | 42.93705 | 43 mine encounters |
| Y | 7.00000 | 7 passes required |
| X | 0.98440 | 98.44% confidence |

**Interpretation:**

The operation requires 7 passes to achieve 98.44% confidence (exceeding the 95% requirement) that no more than 1 mine remains. Approximately 43 mines will be encountered requiring disposal. Total mission time is 234 hours, equivalent to 11.7 operational days at 20 hours/day tempo.

**Additional Information:** To view expected mines remaining (lambda value), press `RCL L`. Result: 0.18795 mines expected remaining in the entire AOR.
